# What was covered: 
### Classes, types, access attributes, main method


**Why do we care about these access attributes? In what scenario would we want something to be public? Private?**
<ul>
    <li>Helps to determine safety protocol of files and code</li>
    <li>Important to keep variables within classes hidden from rest of program, why?
    <ul>
        <li> Allows for us to have more control over the variables, can create setter and getters!
        <ul>
            <li>Setters and getters?</li>
            <li>Setter = method to set value of a variable</li>
            <li> Getter = method within the class to return the value of a variable
            <ul>
                <li>Why have a “getter”?</li>
                <li>More control, ie want to have some arithmetic with the getter, can just put it once in there </li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

**What makes a static declaration special? Try to figure out how you would explain the concept of static to a young child.**
<ul>
    <li>There is only one instance of it in the class</li>
    <li>Can be used for security to ensure it is harder for an external input to mess with the value</li>
</ul>

**What is the purpose of a constructor?**
A constructor is called only when an object is instantiated. It sets up starting variable values, and can sometimes have multiple instances which are used dependant on the number of arguements input when the constructor is called. 

**How does the compiler know which constructor to choose, and why does it not get confused by having multiple functions with the same name?**
The number of arguements in the parenthesis when the constructor is called.
