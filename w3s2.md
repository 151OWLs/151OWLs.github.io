### Exam Revision


**What is the difference between double and float?**
The number of bits it holds, a double is 64 and a float is 32. 

**What does void mean?**
The function returns nothing

**Abstract class vs interfaces**
Abstract classes have implimented functioned in them, whereas Interfaces do not have any functions written. Good way to remember the difference is Abstract classes we extend (they already have functions but we have to build upon them), and interfaces we impliment (we have to code all of it)

**Why do interfaces exist**
You can impliment many different interfaces when programming, but you can only extend one abstract class

**What are generics, T vs E**
generic T uses only datatypes, so objects cannot be used in the class you are making.    
generic E can use everything
