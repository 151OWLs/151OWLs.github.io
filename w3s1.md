# What was covered: 
### Big Oh
The simplest way to think about Big Oh is to look at the number of loops it has. A singular for loop **that runs to n** will be O(n). For every nested for loop inside, the power n is raised to is incremented. Any search or sort algorithm that splits the array and **doesn't loop over all elements** will be log(n).
