# What are OWLS

Sagana and Lucas are taking over from two previous students (shout out to Emily and Rob) who have since graduated. A lot of the resources for these sessions come from them, and we thank them so much for their hard work and dedication. Both Lucas and Sagana took the CS151 in the Spring of 2020, and were incredibly grateful for the OWL sessions they had.
