# What was covered: 
### Abstract Classes and Interfaces

#### Abstract Classes and Interfaces
**What is the difference between an Abstract Class and an Interface?**
<ul>
    <li>Interface has no body for method declarations</li>
    <li>Think of an interface as a 'table of contents' </li>
    <li>Abstract classes have already bodies</li>
    <li>Think about it in terms of how you use it, an interface you impliment, and an abstract class you extend. So there is a base class you are extending, meaning it already has some content in it</li>
</ul>

**How do you know which one to use in a certain instance?**
If there are methods you want to be across child classes, use an abstract class, but if you want them all to have the same methods, but do different things, use an interface. 

**How do you use an abstract class and interface?**
```
\\abstract class
public abstract class Person(){
    public void Tnumber(){
        system.out.print("T number is");
    }
    public abstract void mealplan();
}

\\interface
public interface Person(){
    public String Tnumber();
    public String meanplan();
}
```

#### Student questions:
**Can you use an abstract class and an interface in the same class**
Yes! And you can impliment more than one interface, but you cannot extend two abstract classes.
