# What was covered: 
### Exceptions, Arrays, Abstract Classes and Interfaces

#### Exceptions:
What is an exception in Java?

What is the difference between an exception and an error? Can you give examples?

Is it important to handle exceptions? Why or why not? Try to come up with a scenario to back up your answer.

What exception will be thrown in the following scenario?
```
int[] owlsAreCute = new int[10];
for (int i = 0; i < owlsAreCute.length; i++) {
    owlsAreCute[i] = i+1;
}
System.out.println(owlsAreCute[10]);
```

#### Arrays:
How are arrays in Java different from lists in python?

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

#### Abstract Classes and Interfaces
What is the difference between an Abstract Class and an Interface?

How do you know which one to use in a certain instance?

How do you use an abstract class and interface?
