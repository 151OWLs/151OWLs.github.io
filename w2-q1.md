# What was covered: 
### Exceptions and Arrays

#### Warm up:
What is a work from home hack that you swear by?

#### Exceptions:
What is an exception in Java?

What is the difference between an exception and an error? Can you give examples?

Is it important to handle exceptions? Why or why not? Try to come up with a scenario to back up your answer.

What exception will be thrown in the following scenario?
```
int[] owlsAreCute = new int[10];
for (int i = 0; i < owlsAreCute.length; i++) {
    owlsAreCute[i] = i+1;
}
System.out.println(owlsAreCute[10]);
```

#### Arrays:
How are arrays in Java different from lists in python?

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
