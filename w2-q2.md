# What was covered: 
### Inheritance

#### Warm up:
If real-world factors like salary/money, location, etc weren't a factor, what would you do with your life?

Questions from class?

#### Inheritance:
Problem: The manager at the Oberlin hotel wants to revamp their management system, you've been tasked to do this. The first thing you need to update is the system that organizes rooms/their fares/occupancy/other features you may think are relevant. Design a `parent class Room` and appropriate `child classes` to organize your data. 
> *Note:* While many rooms have similar features that could be captured in variables, some rooms will need special methods for `cleanRoom (Array[Employees] employees)` which returns employees that are able to clean a given room after people check out. Another special method is `Array[menuItems] menu roomService(int accountNumber)` which returns different menuItems available to different rooms based on the kind of room. Who knows if this is actually a good system, you just have to implement it 
Add any other features you may think is cool. Dont compile your code
You'll have to use abstract classes

Why wont: 
`ArrayList<int> L = new ArrayList<int>();`compile? I also tried `ArrayList<float> L = new ArrayList<float>();` and even `ArrayList<bigInt> L = new ArrayList<bigInt>();`
