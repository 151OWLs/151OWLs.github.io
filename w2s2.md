# What was covered: 
### Stacks and Queues

#### Stacks
Imagine a pile of books, you have to put the book on the top when you add a book, and if you want to take one off you have to take the first one off before you can get to the next one. 
Last In First Out

#### Queues
Imagine a line at a bank. As a person enters the bank they go to the back of the line, and the teller calls someone from the front to be served. 
First In First Out


#### Genetics
**Why do we use genetics**
Genetics are used so there there is more flexibility around storage, since the class doesn't care what type the object is, just that, in the case of something like an arraylist, all elements are the same type.
