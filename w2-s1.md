# What was covered: 
### Exceptions and Arrays

#### Warm up:
**What is a work from home hack that you swear by?**

#### Exceptions:
**What is an exception in Java?**

**What is the difference between an exception and an error? Can you give examples?**

**Is it important to handle exceptions? Why or why not? Try to come up with a scenario to back up your answer.**

**What exception will be thrown in the provided scenario?**
```
int[] owlsAreCute = new int[10];
for (int i = 0; i < owlsAreCute.length; i++) {
    owlsAreCute[i] = i+1;
}
System.out.println(owlsAreCute[10]);
```

#### Arrays:
**How are arrays in Java different from lists in python?**

**Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.**
