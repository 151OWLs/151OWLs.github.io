# What was covered: 
### Exceptions and Arrays

#### Exceptions:
**What is an exception in Java?**
<ul>
    <li>Problem that happens during the runtime of a program
    <ul>
        <li>We can handle with try catch or throw statement!</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</li>

**What is the difference between an exception and an error? Can you give examples?**
<ul>
    <li>Exceptions caused by code/program</li>
    </li>Error caused by system (can’t really control)
        <ul>
            <li>Ie ran out of memory</li>
            <li>You can create an error with an infinite loop</li>
            <li>Can be caught by the compiler, but sometimes not</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

**Is it important to handle exceptions? Why or why not? Try to come up with a scenario to back up your answer.**
<ul>
    <li>Example: divide by zero, will run normally but user will get error if they try to put 0</li>
</ul>

**What exception will be thrown in the provided scenario?**
<ul>
    <li>IndexOutOfBounds Exception</li>
<ul>

#### Arrays:
**How are arrays in Java different from lists in python?**
<ul>
    <li>Python, don’t need to initialize a size for the list</li>
    <li>Can put almost any object/type in a list in python, Java can’t</li>
</ul>

**Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.**
Assume you have int target and array named arr
```
//variables for return indices
int result1;
int result2;
For (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
for(int j = i+1; j < arr.length; j++) {
if((arr[i] + arr[j]) == target) {
result1 = i;
result2 = j;
}
}
}
int returnArray = new int[2];
returnArray[0] = result1;
returnArray[1] = result2;
return returnArray;
```
